=== About ===
* Most HTML5 semantics used when possible
* Theme works best as a resume and portfolio template. Blogging is supported with trackbacks and ping status.
* This theme is not particularly a Responsive layout template but it will perform well on most screen sizes.
* Print styles are designed to give you a good printable page.
 
== Instructions ==
* Use the Posts to add portfolio entries and set your theme to Front page displays "A static page" in Reading > Settings. This will make your Portfolio appear where the blog page would normally appear by setting the portfolio page as a "Posts page."

* If you want to have your Cover Letter on the first page then create a menu for Cover Letter Page, and then do the same by setting your "A static page" as the Cover Letter.

* Using the "Recent Post" widget as your primary widget will show the "posts" you made for your Profile page. In the title of the widget you can put something like, "Profile and Activities" to make the title reference the Profile page articles (posts).

* If you want to print your resume without the sidebar you can find that option in the "Customize" admin section.
